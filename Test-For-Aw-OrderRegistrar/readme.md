# The assigment

"Create an order system, with business logic that provide discounts."
There was some given business rules for discounts, depending on small, large. 

This assigment was very open in all ways. So i chose to build it as a console app, for the lols. :)

* I chose to use a c# implementation of DDD
* Use can browse orders, go back and forth in the menu system
* Print the order in the console
* I used TDD in a BDD-ish way (restricted to Microsoft testing framework) using FluentAssertions and Moq


# Build

* Open the .sln
* Hit F5
* Have fun!
